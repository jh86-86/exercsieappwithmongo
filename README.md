A simple exercise app using react on the front end.

I am writing this app to improve my backend skills with node and to use for the very first time
mongoDB. I will use Atlas. As it is my first time using a non-relational database I will explore its uses.

 I will also learn all the crud operations for this app and weave it with node. 

 I will eventually dockerise it and deploy it using AWS.

I will use css modules for styling.
