A simple exercise app using react on the front end.

I am writing this app to improve my backend skills with node and to use for the very first time
mongoDB. I will use Atlas. As it is my first time using a non-relational database I will explore its uses.

I will also learn all the crud operations for this app with Mongo and weave it with node. 

I will eventually dockerise it and deploy it using AWS.

I will use css modules for styling and bootstrap.

Currently I am working on building a tracker which will take long and lat and populate a map so that there is a route tracked. It will also record time take. 

using react components and constructors over state initially but will use state,useEffect and reducer.

Other plans are to add auth0 and sockets to incorporate a chat function.
